## üåü About

**React Card Dealer** initializes a new shuffled deck from the [Deck of Cards API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/) on load, and lets you draw one card at a time. When the deck is empty, it alerts you that no cards remain.

- **Draw Cards:** Click ‚ÄúDraw Card‚Äù to fetch and display the next card image.  
- **Empty Deck Alert:** When all cards are drawn, an alert pops up:  
  > ‚ÄúError: no cards remaining!‚Äù
